#Fractal Designer

Design cool fractals with your fingertips! Easily design swirls, spirals, snowflakes, dragons,  ferns, trees, and other plants, and thousands more fun fractal shapes limited only by your amazing creativity.

This Android app allows you to create [Iterated Function System (IFS)][wiki_ifs] fractals in a simple, intuitive manner by modifying boxes called 'transformations.' Each transformation contributes to the fractal image in a unique way which depends on each of the other transformations. The possibilities are endless, and it's up to you to see what you can create.  Use the editor to design, and save the pictures to your phone.  There is also a gradient editor used to design your own color schemes. Enjoy!

##Dependencies and Incorporated Libraries

This app is based upon a framework I have made which you will need to use as a library project.  The framework is available at its github page: [Resonos Android Framework][github_resonos]

As mentioned on the framework's page, you will need the [HoloEverywhere][github_holo] library because this framework uses ICS styling on all versions of Android. You will also need the [ActionBarSherlock][site_abs] library in order to use the Action Bar on all versions of Android.

##Software Requirements

This app has been designed for Android 2.1 and higher.  It may work with Android 1.6 but I decided to not support that platform as it is used by less than 2% of all Android users.
