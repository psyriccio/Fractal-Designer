    <string name="help02a">Thank you for upgrading Fractal Designer! Your support is appreciated.</string>
    <string name="help03">The Editor is where all of the magic happensâ€”in it you can create infinite varieties of fractals.</string>
    <string name="help04">Here we are in the editor, on an empty white board with a box. Nothing is hereâ€”yet. We can pan around by dragging one finger, and zoom in and out using a two-finger pinch gesture. Try it out!</string>
    <string name="help05">Fractals are composed of boxes, which you can add using this button.</string>
    <string name="help06">A box is just thatâ€”a square that you can move (using the blue circle), rotate (using the pink circle), resize (using the green circle), and skew (using the two red circles). Try it on your own to get comfortable.</string>
    <string name="help07">Now let\'s create a fractal. Watch the assembly stepsâ€¦</string>
    <string name="help08">Here we\'ve moved the first box into place</string>
    <string name="help09">Now we\'ve created another boxâ€¦</string>
    <string name="help10">â€¦and moved it into place. Look at thatâ€”already, we have a fractal! Now watch something really cool.</string>
    <string name="help11">See just how easy it is to create endless fractals? Now how the boxes create these beautiful fractals is what you\'ll have to figure out on your own.</string>
    <string name="help12">You can open and save fractals using the Action Bar buttons above.</string>
    <string name="help13">And in the menu you can enable or disable a grid, and if you ever lose some boxes you had onscreen, restore them.</string>
    <string name="help14">This editor is great, but the fractal looks kind of ugly stillâ€¦</string>
    <string name="help15">So let\'s render it!</string>
    <string name="help16">Rendering takes a short amount of time, indicated by the progress in the action bar. Like the editor, you can pan and zoom with your fingers, but the fractal will need to rerender. The farther you zoom in, the longer it will take.</string>
    <string name="help17">The quality button opens up two sliders. The detail level controls how detailed the render will be, but also how long it will take.</string>
    <string name="help18">The color steps slider indicates how fast colors change. When you render things on your own, try playing with them to find the best look for your fractal.</string>
    <string name="help19">You can change the color scheme as well. There are a variety of defaults for you to explore later. By upgrading, you will be able to design your own.</string>
    <string name="help19a">You can change the color scheme as well. There are a variety of defaults for you to explore later. You can also design your own.</string>
    <string name="help20">Using the action bar, you can save an image, share the fractal, or set it as your wallpaper.</string>
    <string name="help21">Let\'s go back home now to see the Gallery.</string>
    <string name="help22">The Gallery stores any fractals that you wish to save, as well as a variety of samples to get you started.</string>
    <string name="help23">Here you can see all of the fractals, organized into categories. You can be drag your screen left or right to browse. Fractals saved by the user are in the rightmost category.</string>
    <string name="help24">This ends your tutorial. Enjoy using Fractal Designer! Please consider purchasing the full version!</string>
    <string name="help24a">This ends your tutorial. Enjoy using Fractal Designer! Thank you for upgrading!</string>
